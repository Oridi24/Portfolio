#  *My Data Journey: Portfolio Overview*

*Hey there!üññ Welcome to my portfolio.  
This is a technical and personal showcase of the tools, languages, and technologies I‚Äôve learned and applied on my journey through the world of **Big Data**, **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**.*

*Each section includes a brief description and a direct link to the corresponding repository. Feel free to explore, learn, and hopefully find some inspiration!*

*Hands-on exercises using **SQL**, focused on querying relational databases.*

***Topics include:***
- *Joins, subqueries, aggregation functions, filtering and conditional logic,real-world data analysis practice*


## </> *Python for Data Analysis*:  ‚û°Ô∏è *[View Repository](https://github.com/Oridi24/Python-Activities.git))*

*Practical Python applications for working with structured datasets.*


## üìà *Statistics & Linear Algebra*:  ‚û°Ô∏è *[View Repository](https://github.com/Oridi24/Statistics-Linear-Algebra-Data-Minning.git)*

*Projects developed in **R**, focused on statistical analysis from foundational concepts to applied techniques.*

***Techniques applied:***
- *Exploratory and confirmatory analysis, outlier detection, and handling.*
- *Statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, correlations), metrics like MSE and R¬≤.*   
- *Linear regression and model diagnostics.*


## ‚öôÔ∏è *Scala & Apache Spark:*  ‚û°Ô∏è *[View Repository](https://github.com/Oridi24/Scala-Spark.git)*

*Strong foundation in **Scala** and its integration with **Apache Spark** for distributed data processing.*

***Focus areas:***
- *Functional programming principles with Scala.* 
- *Spark DataFrames, RDDs, transformations and Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology for worlflows.*


## üìä *Power BI:*  ‚û°Ô∏è *[View Repository](https://github.com/Oridi24/Power-BI-KC.git)*

*Creating data storytelling with visual design*

***Key skills:***   
- *Data connections from Excel, SQL, and more.*
- *Interactive dashboard creation, Custom metrics with DAX*
  

## *Final Thoughts*:

*Every project here represents much more than code ‚Äî it's a testament to continuous learning, perseverance, and problem-solving.*  
*If you've made it this far, thank you for your time. I hope this portfolio inspires you or helps in your own journey.*

*> _‚ÄúLearning to code is learning to think. And thinking with data is learning to see the world in a new way.‚Äù_*
