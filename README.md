📌 *Traffic Accident Severity Prediction: Case Study Description:*
*Road traffic accidents have a significant social and economic impact. This project develops a Machine Learning model to predict whether an accident will be minor (0) or severe (1), based on contextual factors such as road conditions, weather, time, and number of vehicles involved.*

- ***Challenge**: Highly imbalanced dataset (~80% minor, 20% severe).*
- ***Approach**: Preprocessing, feature engineering, cross-validation, and testing multiple algorithms.* 

  ***Development Methodology:***

1. *Data Preprocessing*
2. *Model Training & Evaluation:*
    - ***Algorithms tested**: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Logistic Regression (with class weights and SMOTE), Balanced Random Forest, and Easy Ensemble.*
3. *Validation techniques: StratifiedKFold for ensemble methods and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.*
4. *Metrics for Performance Assessment: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Average Precision.*
5. *Deployment: The final model was deployed with FastAPI as a REST endpoint (/predict), allowing real-time accident severity predictions.Output includes both the predicted class (0 = minor, 1 = severe) and the probability of a severe accident.*
6. *Recorded Video Walkthrough: a 8-minute presentation explaining the case study, the modeling approach, and the practical implications of deploying the predictive system.*

***Results:***
 - ✅ *Balanced Random Forest delivered the best trade-off, with strong recall for severe accidents.*
