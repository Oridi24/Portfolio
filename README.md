## 📖 *Natural Language Processing (NLP)* : **Currently working on this...**

*Developed in **Python** This project presents a complete NLP pipeline for sentiment analysis, covering the most important stages in a traditional workflow, and demonstrates a hands-on approach to solving a real-world text classification problem using classic NLP techniques and machine learning tools:*

1. ***Corpus Download & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the distribution of reviews, extracting frequent n-grams, plotting word clouds, and analyzing word embeddings with Word2Vec.*
2. ***Text Preprocessing:** Implementation of a robust text cleaning function (lowercasing, punctuation and stopword removal, etc.) to prepare raw reviews for modeling.*
3. ***Model Training & Evaluation:** Training and comparing two different machine learning models using a Bag-of-Words representation, evaluating their performance with precision, recall, and F1-score.*
4. ***Final Report & Conclusions:** Interpretation of results, final model selection, and insights about potential improvements.*
